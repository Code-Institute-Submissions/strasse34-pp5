- Add/edit page also used for add posts, edit posts and edit profile

<details><summary>Home Page logged out</summary>

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  - React (17.0.2)

### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - axios were used for promise-based HTTP. Justification: I used axios to send API requests from the React project to the API and avoid any CORS errors when sending cookies.
- [ClassNames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames/) - JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together, used in the FeedbackMsg component. This is used to apply the styles dynamically based on the type of style and apply more than one style to elements in FeedbackMsg component
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - library to decode out JSON Web token. Justification: I used JWT to prevent unauthenticated user from making extra networkÂ requests to refresh their access token. Also used to remove the timestamp from the browser when the user refreshes token expires or the user logs out.
- [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) - a 3rd party library used by React-Bootstrap. Justification: I used Popper to make sure the dropdown menus position is fixed on all browsers.
- [React 17](https://17.reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [React-Bootstrap 4.6](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) - Justification: I used Bootstrap React library for UI components, styling and responsiveness.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - Justification: I used this component to load content (posts/comments) automatically as the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page without having to jump to next/previous page.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - used for dynamic routing. Justification: I used this library to enable the navigation among views of various components and control what the user sees depending on the URL they have accessed in the browser.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): This extension was used to format code for all files

### Tools & Programs

## Agile design

### About

- Agile development is the most effective way to development of any website
- This was able to do basic development of website using user story template

### User Story Template

- Using Github issues first I created the template for a user story that was later used to create user stories. I created three labels: must have, could have, should have.

<details><summary>See User story template</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/issue-template.png">
</details>

### Kanban Board

- As a visual representation of the project's status, showing what tasks are to be done, in progress and completed.Each task is represented as a card on the board, and the cards can be moved from one column to another to show progress.

<details><summary>See Kanban board</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/kanban.png">
</details>

### Moscow Prioritisation

- The Moscow prioritization technique is used to prioritize project requirements based on their importance.

<details><summary>See Image</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/moscow.png">
</details>

### Milestones

- Milestones are created with a aim of finishing a task on a certain date. I have created 6 milestones for this project and linked them with issues related.

<details><summary>See Image</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/mileston.png">
</details>

## Design

### Colours

- I have tried to keep the color of the website simple, light and in matching with the logo.
- I tried to find the similar palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/?home)

<details><summary>See General Color Palette</summary>
<img src="docs/palette/general.png">
</details>
<details><summary>See Sign in/up Color Palette</summary>
<img src="docs/palette/signinup.png">
</details>

### Fonts

- Google fonts "DM Sans", sans-serif; font were used for this project as it offers clean and legible design, which makes it easy to read on screens of different sizes and resolutions. It has a neutral appearance and doesn't have any distracting features that can make it difficult to read.

## Project Structure
