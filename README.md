## Wireframes

- A low-fi wireframe was build before developing the website.

- Most of the pages has same design so a basic wireframe was created for the following pages:
- Home page also used for feed and interested page
- Add/edit page also used for add posts, edit posts and edit profile

<details><summary>Home Page logged out</summary>

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  - React (17.0.2)

### Libraries, frameworks and dependencies

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - axios were used for promise-based HTTP. Justification: I used axios to send API requests from the React project to the API and avoid any CORS errors when sending cookies.
- [ClassNames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames/) - JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together, used in the FeedbackMsg component. This is used to apply the styles dynamically based on the type of style and apply more than one style to elements in FeedbackMsg component
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - library to decode out JSON Web token. Justification: I used JWT to prevent unauthenticated user from making extra networkÂ requests to refresh their access token. Also used to remove the timestamp from the browser when the user refreshes token expires or the user logs out.
- [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) - a 3rd party library used by React-Bootstrap. Justification: I used Popper to make sure the dropdown menus position is fixed on all browsers.
- [React 17](https://17.reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [React-Bootstrap 4.6](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) - Justification: I used Bootstrap React library for UI components, styling and responsiveness.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - Justification: I used this component to load content (posts/comments) automatically as the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page without having to jump to next/previous page.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - used for dynamic routing. Justification: I used this library to enable the navigation among views of various components and control what the user sees depending on the URL they have accessed in the browser.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): This extension was used to format code for all files

### Tools & Programs

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used to create the multi-device mock-up at the top of this README.md file

## Agile design

### About

- Agile development is the most effective way to development of any website
- This was able to do basic development of website using user story template

### User Story Template

- Using Github issues first I created the template for a user story that was later used to create user stories. I created three labels: must have, could have, should have.

<details><summary>See User story template</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/issue-template.png">
</details>

### Kanban Board

- As a visual representation of the project's status, showing what tasks are to be done, in progress and completed.Each task is represented as a card on the board, and the cards can be moved from one column to another to show progress.

<details><summary>See Kanban board</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/kanban.png">
</details>

### Moscow Prioritisation

- The Moscow prioritization technique is used to prioritize project requirements based on their importance.

<details><summary>See Image</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/moscow.png">
</details>

### Milestones

- Milestones are created with a aim of finishing a task on a certain date. I have created 6 milestones for this project and linked them with issues related.

<details><summary>See Image</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/mileston.png">
</details>

## Design

### Colours

- I have tried to keep the color of the website simple, light and in matching with the logo.
- I tried to find the similar palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/?home)

<details><summary>See General Color Palette</summary>
<img src="docs/palette/general.png">
</details>
<details><summary>See Sign in/up Color Palette</summary>
<img src="docs/palette/signinup.png">
</details>

### Fonts

- Google fonts "DM Sans", sans-serif; font were used for this project as it offers clean and legible design, which makes it easy to read on screens of different sizes and resolutions. It has a neutral appearance and doesn't have any distracting features that can make it difficult to read.

<details><summary>See DM Sans</summary>

## Project Structure

### Front-End

#### React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state at any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of independent and reusable components ([source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795/)).

There were various components created and reused across this application.

- `<Asset />` - multi purpose component, used to display a range of items due to being passed props.

  - Those include a loading spinner from React Bootstrap, image with source and alt attribute or a message consisting of a paragraph.

- `<Avatar />` - resuable component, used to display the relevant user profile picture.

  - This component uses props which can specify the source of the image and also its size
  - This components was used in profile avatar, post owner, comment create form and comments posted

- `<DropDowns />` - resuable component, used to display the three dots option button based on the required rights of the user.

  - This was used for user who are authorised to make changes. For example, for user to edit and delete their own comments and user to edit their profile, change their username and password.

- `<EditStars />` - resuable component, used to display editable stars while editing comments.

  - This component uses props which can get the stars value for farther process.

  - This component was used in when comment list is created.

- `<StarRating />` - resuable component, used to able user to rate a post by selecting stars while commenting.

  - This component was used in when user rate a post.

### Html

- [WC3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html in the project
- The deployed app was passed as url input for validation
- No errors were found
- Note : info were provided regarding standard Meta code

### Lighthouse

- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO analysis of the project code here are the results:

- While conducting lighthouse validation of profile edit page, username and password change page lighthouse was refreshing and testing the home page so I have not included the test results

- Note: Lighthouse results of testing the project may be inconsistent due to the functionality of user-uploaded images,Hosting project on Heroku may affected the results (server response time, caching, and network latency). Also additional external libraries reduce the response of the website. I will try improve in further projects to acheive better.

### ESLint Validation

- The JSX code was validated using the ESLint utility.
- The library was preinstalled in Codeanywhere IDE
- The code was getting validated so the errors were corrected during development process
- The library was also installed later using [ESLint website](https://eslint.org/) for final validation
- Few errors were shown which has been documented in Bug and fixes in TESTING.md
- No errors remained before final submission
